# QuickBlox Hacktoberfest Challenge Submission: CyberMedix

GitHub handle: Mrinank-Bhowmick

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: CyberMedix

**Description**: You are CyberMedix, an intelligent healthcare assistant designed to provide accurate, safe, and reliable health-related information to users.

## Technical Details

**Tech Stack**: React, QuickBlox SDK

**QuickBlox Integration**: CyberMedix leverages QuickBlox's SmartChat Assistant for real-time healthcare assistance through personalized chat. Linked to a QuickBlox user, the assistant interacts in both private and group chats, providing accurate health-related advice from a well-curated knowledge base. The SmartChat Assistant adapts its responses based on user queries, delivering context-aware, personalized support. If a query is beyond its scope, it escalates by consulting OpenAI or using custom webhooks, ensuring a seamless and reliable communication experience.

## Additional Information

**Challenges Faced**: During development, I faced issues with integrating QuickBlox SDK, particularly in optimizing the SmartChat Assistant’s system instructions and expanding its knowledge base for more accurate healthcare responses. To resolve this, I refined the assistant’s system messages for better interaction and ensured the knowledge base was concise and relevant to health topics. Additionally, UI challenges were managed by using React components, though further polish is needed.

**Future Improvements**: If I had more time, I would focus on enhancing the UI by moving the app to Next.js with SSR and a serverless architecture for scalability. I would also add a feature for patients to upload medical reports, allowing the assistant to offer more personalized advice based on the reports.
